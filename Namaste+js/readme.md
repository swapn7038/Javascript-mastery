### Namaste+JS Ep :- 5 (shortest js program)

Shortest js program is an empty file.
Js still create window.

These big object has lot of variables and function in it. These functions can be created by js engine. We didn't create this.

We can access these functions and variables anywhere in the program.

Also js engine gives us this keyword. At global level this points to the window object.

Window is global object.

### Namaste+JS Ep :- 6 (undefined vs defined)

Not defined is something where memory allocation is not done.

undefined is where memory is allocated but, value is not defined

js is loosely types language, loosely typed languages are also known as weekely-types language.

coersion => changing one thing to other

### Namaste+JS Ep :- 7 (scope & lexical environment in Js)

scope in js is directyly related to lexical environment. Very classic example in js.

scope is place where you can access specific variable.

When we say what is the scope of any variable, that means we say where we can access the variable in our program.
scope is directly depend on lexical environment.
