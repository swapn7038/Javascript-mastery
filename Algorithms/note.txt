As a froent-end developer we will not use these 
algorithims in our day to day life. 

But it is expected that we must know them. 

Math, search and sorting are must know things, as a 
CS graduate you must know these algorithims. 

Algorithm design techniques ( As a developer you must 
aware of these techniques )


1. Brute Force Ex : Linear Search 

2. Greedy approach Ex : Dijkstra's Algorithm, Prim's Algorithm, 
and Kruskal Algorithm

3. Divide and Conquer Ex : Binary Search, Quick Sort, 
 Merge Sort, Tower Of Hanoi 

 4. Dynamic Programming ( Memoization ) Ex : Fibonachi, climbing staircase

 5. Backtracking Ex: N-Queens problems 


 -----
 Solve some of these problems 

 1. Finding the GCD using Euclidian Algorithm
 2. Finding permutations and combination of a list of numbers
 3. Finding the longest common substring in a given substring
 4. Knapsack problem
