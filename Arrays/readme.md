# JS Arrays (thapa technical => Complete Javascript)

In javascript or any other programming language, with the help of array we can store multiple values in a variable at a time, and we called this variable as an array.

When we use variable, we can stored only one value at a time.

When we want to store multiple values at a time in a variable then we can use the array.

In JS, we have an Array class, and arrays are the prototype of this class.

In JS we can store multiple types of data types. Like int, string, float in single array.

Index 0 => Lower Index/Lower Boundry
Index Last => Upper Index/Upper Boundry
