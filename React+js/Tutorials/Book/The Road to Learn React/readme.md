# The Road to Learn React by robin wieruch

Knowing react is not enough, be master of it.

## Introduction to React

Sobatach jsx ani ReactDOM pan baghu.

React ne single page application (SPA) banvyala help hote. React ani other framweworks ne modern web applications banvyala help hote.

React is not an SPA framework but a view library. It is the V in the MVC (model view controller).
React enables us to render components as viewable elements in browser.
Ecosystem around react makes possible to make SPA in react.

Why you should learn react -> react only helps you to build our view layer. It's a library not a framework. Idea behind it is -> our view is a hierarchy of composable components.

Requirement -> html, css, js, node install pahije

### Node and npm

npm -> node package manager allows us to install external node packages from command line tools.
This packages can be set of utility functions, libraries or whole frameworks.

npm i -g <globally>

-g packege tells to install package globally.
Local packages are used in our application. ex react as a library will be a local package which can be required in your application for usage.
