<p>
  Create a html form that has a number of Textboxes. When the form runs in the
  browser fill the Textboxes with data. Write Js code that verifies that all
  Textboxes have been filled. If a Textbox has been left empty, popup an Alert
  indication which Textbox has been left empty. When the alert's OK button is
  clicked on, Set focus to that specific Textbox. If all the Textboxes are
  filled, display a Thank You alert.
