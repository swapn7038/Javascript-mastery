Javascript Timing events

---

The window object allows execution of code at specified time function.

These time intervals are called timing events.

The two key methods to use with Javascript are :

1. setTimeout(function, milliseconds)
   => Execute a function, after waiting a specified number of milliseconds

2. setInterval(function, milliseconds)
   => Same as setTimeout(), but repeats the execution of the function continuously.

1) setTimeout()
2) clearTimeout()
3) setInterval()
4) clearInterval()
