    In addition to wider range of bulit-in objects, js permits the creation of
    user defined objects. As with every other object, a user-defined object will
    also be associated with properties and methods, which belong to it. After
    creation of such object, any number of instances of this object can be
    created and used. For ex: name, age, and marks obtained by a student needs
    to be stored and there are fifty such students. Is is completely possible in
    Js to create and object named Student, which has three properties name, age,
    and marks. The object Student also will include a method insert() Properties
    1. Student.Age 2. Student.Name 3. Student.Marks Methods 1. Student.insert()
